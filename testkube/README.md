# Testkube

## Summary

While Testkube allows us to write tests, they have to be executed in specific executors (e.g. cURL, Postman, ...). While we can write our own executors, the process is more convoluted than simply running a script within a container, as with other frameworks.

Testkube offers a Beta of Test Workflows, which is more like workflows in other frameworks. However, this is a Pro only feature.

Dashboards have also recently become locked behind the Pro version.
